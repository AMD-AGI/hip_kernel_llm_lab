# hip-kernel-llm-lab

> A HIP kernel LLM training framework covering continued pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning.

`hip-kernel-llm-lab` is a repository for training and evolving LLMs toward HIP
kernel generation, understanding, optimization, and related engineering tasks.
The project is organized around three training stages and the supporting kernel
data-generation/evaluation tooling needed to run them:

1. Continued pretraining (`cpt`)
2. Supervised fine-tuning (`sft`)
3. Reinforcement learning (`rl`)
4. HIP kernel data generation and optimization (`hip-kernel-generator`)

## Training Scope

### `cpt`

The continued pretraining stage is intended for domain adaptation on HIP
kernel-related corpora, including source code, optimization patterns, compiler
knowledge, runtime usage, and associated engineering context.

### `sft`

The supervised fine-tuning stage is intended for instruction-following behavior
on HIP kernel tasks such as code generation, code transformation, debugging,
optimization suggestions, and reasoning over kernel implementations.

### `rl`

The reinforcement learning stage is intended for further improving model
behavior using task-specific rewards, such as correctness, compilability,
performance-oriented preferences, or other training objectives relevant to HIP
kernel workflows.

### `hip-kernel-generator`

The generator tools build and refine data for HIP kernel training workflows.
They cover:

- PyTorch module to PyTorch functional conversion
- PyTorch module to HIP kernel generation
- HIP kernel to optimized HIP kernel transformation

These tools are useful for producing SFT examples, RL seed data, and artifacts
that can be inspected or replayed during model development.

## Planned Workflow

The intended high-level training flow is:

1. Use continued pretraining to adapt the base model to HIP kernel and
   GPU-system-specific knowledge.
2. Use supervised fine-tuning to teach task-oriented instruction behavior.
3. Use reinforcement learning to optimize for downstream quality signals such as
   correctness, preference alignment, and performance-related objectives.

## Quick Start

### Continued Pretraining

```bash
cd cpt
bash run_train_cpt.sh
```

The default CPT YAMLs are under `cpt/train_yamls/`.

### Supervised Fine-Tuning

```bash
cd sft
bash run_train_full_sft.sh
```

The default SFT YAML is `sft/train_yamls/qwen3-14b-full-sft-hip.yaml`.
Update its `dataset`, `model_name_or_path`, and `output_dir` fields before
launching a new run.

### Reinforcement Learning

Start the HIP evaluation server first:

```bash
cd rl/rl4kernel_hip/hip_kernel_evaluation_server
HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 ./setup_server_req_deploy_hip2hip_batch.sh
```

Then launch HIP2HIP single-turn RL training:

```bash
cd rl/rl4kernel_hip
export WANDB_API_KEY=...
bash scripts/train/react_single_turn_v1_hip2hip.sh \
  --train path/to/train.parquet \
  --val path/to/val.parquet \
  --sf-url http://host:8080/run_code
```

### HIP Kernel Data Generation

Install the specific generator package you need:

```bash
cd hip-kernel-generator
pip install -e ./torch_modu2func_kit[dev]
pip install -e ./torch2hip_kit[dev]
pip install -e ./py_hip_kernel2kernel_kit[dev]
```

See `hip-kernel-generator/README.md` for package-specific CLI examples.

## Current Status

This repository contains runnable assets for all main stages:

- `cpt/` and `sft/` provide LLaMA-Factory based launchers and training YAMLs.
- `rl/rl4kernel_hip/` provides a veRL-based HIP kernel RL stack, reward code,
  dataset conversion docs, training launchers, and evaluation server tooling.
- `hip-kernel-generator/` provides installable tools for PyTorch-to-HIP and
  HIP-to-HIP generation/optimization workflows.
- Stage-specific READMEs contain the operational details for each workflow.

## Code Ownership

Current repository ownership is defined in [`.github/CODEOWNERS`](.github/CODEOWNERS).

Temporary owners for the repository are:

- `@AMD-AGI/AI-Algorithm`
- `@liuji` `@zepingli` `@chushi` `@zihao` `@puyuan`

Because the code for each training stage has not been added yet, ownership is
currently maintained at the repository level. More granular ownership can be
introduced after `cpt`, `sft`, and `rl` receive their stage-specific code.
